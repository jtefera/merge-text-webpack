    /*
        I write this as the webpack documentation is scarse for the things needed for this plugin.
        Webpack has a kind of event system to which plugins attach themself.
        To each plugin, webpack passes a reference to its compiler.
        The compiler goes through different steps and each time a step
        happens, Webpack sends the corresponding event.
        The way to hook to those events is through the plugin method below.
        There are many different events. The one of particular interest for this
        plugin is the "emit" event.
        This is the last event before the files are created on their directory.
        (There are other events after this one but are mainly for stats purposes)
        At this point, the extract-text-webpack-plugin plugin, has created those that
        would be the extracted files that we want to merge. They are saved under the assets object
        in the "compilation" object. Each entry into the assets object will be a file created.
        What this plugin will do is check first all the present entries to see which pass the test for the files
        we want to merge (e.g. Files ending with "style.css"), create a new entry with the name given
        in the filename option merging all the filtered entries, delete the entries from the assets object leaving
        only our new file and the files that didn´t pass the fitler.
